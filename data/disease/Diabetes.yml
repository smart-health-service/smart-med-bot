- - Diabetes
  - Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. And it  is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.
- - types of diabetes
  - There are four main types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, and a condition known as prediabetes, in which you have higher-than-normal blood glucose levels but not quite high enough (yet) to qualify as Type 2 diabetes.
- - diabetes symptoms
  - Type 1 diabetes occurs when your pancreas can’t produce enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t make enough of it to control your blood sugar levels.
- - diabetes precautions
  - You can’t prevent type 1 diabetes. However, you may prevent type 2 diabetes with several lifestyle changes, like the following: /nReach and maintain a healthy weight. /nExercise for at least 30 minutes, five days a week. /nEat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins./nHave regular blood sugar checks if you have a family history of the disease.
