- - kidney disease
  - Kidney disease means your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood the way they should. You are at greater risk for kidney disease if you have diabetes or high blood pressure. If you experience kidney failure, treatments include kidney transplant or dialysis.
- - What causes kidney diseases?
  - The term kidney disease refers to three main conditions:

    nephritis
    nephrotic syndrome
    nephrosis
    Each of these conditions is the result of unique conditions or diseases.

    Nephritis (kidney inflammation) can result from an infection, a medication you’re taking, or an autoimmune disorder.

    Nephrotic syndrome is a condition that causes your kidneys to produce high levels of protein in your urine. It’s often the result of kidney damage.

    Nephrosis is a type of kidney disease that ultimately can lead to kidney failure. It’s also often the result of damage to the kidneys from either physical or chemical changes.

    Stop smoking and drinking.

    Exercise for 30 minutes, five days a week.
    Have regular blood and urine tests if you have a family history of the disease.
